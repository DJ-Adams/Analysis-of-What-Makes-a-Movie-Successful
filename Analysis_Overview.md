# Movie Review Analysis and Predictor Summary

Using this dataset we explored NLP modeling techniques to categorize low or high reviews.

We used machine learning models, tensorflow, and other text classification techniques to 
create clean the text, group and analyze.

We created Word Clouds, Frequency Distribution Charts as well as N-grams to be able to understand 
what makes a review positve or negative.

We used a Random Forest Model, tuned it with Grid SearchCV and compared it to Bidirectional GRU 
to obtain predictive results. We were able to obtain 84% accuracy for our best model.

Then we used Streamlit to deploy our model and create a user friendly app to explore the results.
